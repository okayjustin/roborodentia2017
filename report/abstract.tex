Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly-capable alternatives to traditional problem solving schemes due to their ability to solve non-linear systems with a non-algorithmic approach. The applications of ANNs range from process control to pattern recognition and, with increasing importance, robotics. This paper demonstrates continuous control of a robot using an actor-critic algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) originally conceived by Google DeepMind. The robot performs tasks such as locomotion within an enclosed area and object transportation. The paper also details the robot design process and explores the challenges of implementation in a real-time system.
