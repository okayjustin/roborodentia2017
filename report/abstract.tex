Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly-capable alternatives to traditional problem solving schemes due to their ability to solve non-linear systems with a non-algorithmic approach. The applications of ANNs range from process control to pattern recognition and, with increasing importance, robotics. This paper demonstrates continuous control of a robot using the deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) algorithm, an actor-critic reinforcement learning strategy, originally conceived by Google DeepMind. After training, the robot performs controlled locomotion within an enclosed area. The paper also details the robot design process and explores the challenges of  implementation in a real-time system.
