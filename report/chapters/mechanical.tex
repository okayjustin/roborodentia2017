\chapter{Mechanical Design}
\section{Introduction}
The robot meets the design specification shown in Table \ref{tab:roborodentia_reqs}. It consists of four subassemblies: the base platform, shooting mechanism, ball hopper, and control unit. Each section was first modeled in SolidWorks, an industry-standard solid modeling CAD program. The designed parts were then fabricated using a laser cutter or 3D printer and assembled with metric hardware. Figure \ref{fig:robot_photo} displays a photograph of the robot while figures \ref{fig:render_isometric} through \ref{fig:render_right} show standard view renders of the SolidWorks model. Note that the robot uses mecanum wheels (a type of omni-directional wheel) which are modeled here as regular wheels for simplicity. Figure \ref{fig:render_top} also indicates the front, left, back/rear, and right sides of the robot as referenced in the rest of the paper.  The robot contains 51 unique parts, of which 23 are custom designed, and 388 parts in total. The bill of materials can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:mech_bom}.

The design emphasizes the use of 3D printed parts to take advantage of the benefits of the technology including rapid part production, high part complexity, low fabrication cost (excluding the cost of the printer, relative to other methods such as machining, casting, and injection molding), and Parts were printed on a MakerGear M2 3D printer equipped with a 0.35 mm diameter nozzle using MakerGeeks 1.75 mm ABS thermoplastic filament. Print speeds of 20 to 80 mm/s with 0.20 mm layer height, depending on part dimensions and minimum feature size, lead to part print times of 2-5 hours for smaller components up to 14 hours for the ball hopper. Due to the non-isotropic strength characteristic of 3D printed components (greater tensile strength in the X and Y axes but significantly weaker in Z), the designs must specifically take into account printing direction and orientation. Additionally, the print volume of 200 mm x 250 mm x 200 mm limits the maximum part dimensions thus requiring the ball hopper to printed as three separate pieces. 

\section{Base Platform}
The 315 mm by 275 mm base platform of the robot, made from 1/4" medium density fiberboard (MDF), serves as the primary structural component and a mounting point for the motors, electronics, shooting mechanism, and hopper. The wood is laser cut with a 20 mm grid of 4 mm diameter holes to allow modular placement of components and the corner cutouts allow clearance for the wheels. Long slots in the base platform allow wire routing from the motors to the motor drivers above. Figures \ref{fig:base_platform} shows the assembled view of the subassembly.

Four 12V Pololu 37D motors geared at a 70:1 ratio drive each of the 60 mm mecanum wheels. Figure \ref{fig:motor_assem_explode} displays an exploded view of the motor assembly. 3D printed couplings, detailed in Figure \ref{fig:wheel_coupler}, connect the wheels to the 6 mm diameter, D-shaped motor shafts. The couplers use M2 nuts and bolts to clamp on the motor shaft and an octagonal stub that press fits into the center of the wheels. Three long M3 bolts and nylon lock nuts clamp the mecanum wheels together and to the coupler. Each wheel contains eight angled rollers so unlike regular wheels which only produce a force vector perpendicular to the axis, mecanum wheels also produce a vector parallel to the axis. With the appropriate combination of speed and direction of each wheel, the robot can achieve simultaneous translation and rotation in any direction. Two ball bearings at each end of each roller smooth operation under load.

Several electronic components are mounted directly on the base platform. Along the four edges of the platform, four ST Microelectronics VL53L0X laser rangefinders seated on 3D printed brackets sense distance. These sensors cost between \$6 to \$20 mounted on a small PCB with supporting circuitry and can sense distances between 30 mm and 2000 mm at a rate of 30 Hz and less than 10\% error in most test conditions \cite{vl53l0x_datasheet}. A 4S, 1200 mAH LiPo battery mounted with an industrial strength hook-and-loop fastener powers the system through a on/off toggle switch seated in a 3D printed bracket. Three dual H-bridge motor drivers are attached with nylon standoffs and M3 nuts and bolts.

\section{Shooting Mechanism}
The shooting mechanism naturally takes inspiration from the official Nerf Rival Blaster toys since the manufacturer specifically optimized them to fire Nerf Rival balls in a way similar to baseball pitching machines. Figure \ref{fig:shooter_explode} shows an exploded view of the subassembly while Figure \ref{fig:shooter_top} displays the top view. The mechanism consists of two sections: the \textbf{barrel} (left green part in Figure \ref{fig:shooter_explode}) and the \textbf{wheel housing} (right green part in Figure \ref{fig:shooter_explode}). Both parts were fabricated using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer as the geometries are highly complex. Therefore, the shooting mechanism consists of two separate components versus a unibody design to allow each half to be fabricated with optimal print direction, strength, and finish quality. The barrel is angled \ang{6} above horizontal, targeting the vertical center of the nets.

\end{figure}

The \textbf{barrel} directs balls from the \textbf{ball hopper} to the \textbf{wheel housing}. First, the ball enters the barrel through a vertical chute by force of gravity. As the ball falls into the barrel, a high-pressure centrifugal (or blower fan) attached at the back of the barrel pushes it into the wheel housing inlet. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:shooter_xsec}, the barrel slightly narrows in the area behind the top chute to prevent the ball from rolling backwards towards the blower fan. A loft feature creates a smooth transition between the rectangular fan connection and the circular barrel. The foam balls, nominally 23 mm in diameter, would occasionally jam in a 24 mm barrel so all pathways are 25 mm. In the initial design, the pressure created by the blower fan was so high that it prevented the ball from falling down the vertical chute so strategically placed vents reduce the barrel pressure as the ball falls through the chute. As the ball travels down the chute into the barrel, it blocks the vents, increasing the pressure and forcing the ball into the wheel housing.

Inside the \textbf{wheel housing}, two counter-rotating 34mm wheels press fitted to two high-speed 12 V motors rapidly accelerate the foam ball up to 50 feet per second. The 14 mm gap between wheels compresses the ball to increase grip, thereby improving energy transfer. The motors lightly press fit into the wheel housing and are secured with 3D printed braces. The perimeter of each 3D printed wheel, detailed in Figure \ref{fig:shooter_wheel}, consists of a ribbed V-groove to increase the contact patch and grip with the compressed foam ball. Two "feet" with bolt holes at the bottom of the barrel and wheel housing secure the shooting mechanism to the base platform.

\end{figure}

\section{Ball Hopper}
The robot must obtain the foam balls from supply tubes mounted on two sides of the side. The bottoms of the supply tubes are positioned seven inches above the floor and a swinging flap holds the balls in. The ball hopper, shown in Figure \ref{fig:ball_hopper} is a large 3D printed component designed to push the swinging flap away, collect the balls, store them, and dispense them into the shooting mechanism. Figure \ref{fig:ball_hopper_explode} shows an exploded view of the subassembly.

	\caption{Ball Hopper -- Exploded View}	\label{fig:ball_hopper_explode}
\end{figure}

First, the robot moves the hopper underneath the supply tube. As the flap swings open, the balls rolls down the steep sloped portion of the hopper. Visible in the cross section view of Figure \ref{fig:ball_hopper_xsec}, The slope rapidly becomes less steep in order to transition the balls downward momentum into sideways momentum, keeping balls from jamming against each other. The balls then roll into one of two channels before stopping at the dispensing gate.

	\caption{Ball Hopper -- Cross Section View}	\label{fig:ball_hopper_xsec}
\end{figure}

The dispensing gate, shown in Figure \ref{fig:dispensing_gate}, controls the movement of balls between hopper channel and shooting mechanism entrance. Its complex shape directs balls into the center of the ball hopper from one channel at a time to prevent jamming. A common \ang{180} movement servo, mounted in a 3D printed bracket above the center of the hopper, controls the dispensing gate. Fastened to the same bracket, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) measures magnetic compass heading and acceleration in three dimensions.

	\caption{Ball Hopper -- Dispensing Gate}	\label{fig:dispensing_gate}
\end{figure}

The ball hopper is mounted at three points: the top of the shooting mechanism and the left and right edges of the robot using 3D printed and acrylic braces shown in Figure \ref{fig:hopper_brace}.

\end{figure}

\section{Control Unit}
The control unit, shown in Figure \ref{fig:control_unit}, consists of a 1/4" MDF board with various electronic components mounted: two off-the-shelf DC-DC switching converters, a custom interconnect printed circuit board (PCB), an off-the-shelf STM32 Nucleo-64 development board, and the Raspberry Pi computer. Two 3D printed standoffs, the green parts shown in Figure \ref{fig:control_unit_standoffs}, connect the control unit to the platform and raise it slightly to avoid colliding with the robot's wheels.
