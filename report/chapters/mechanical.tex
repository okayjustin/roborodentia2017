\chapter{Mechanical Design}
\section{Introduction}
The robot meets the design specification shown in Table \ref{tab:roborodentia_reqs}. It consists of four subassemblies: the base platform, shooting mechanism, ball hopper, and control unit. Each section was first modeled in SolidWorks, an industry-standard solid modeling CAD program. The designed parts were then fabricated using a laser cutter or 3D printer and assembled with metric hardware. Figure \ref{fig:robot_photo} displays a photograph of the robot while Figures \ref{fig:render_isometric} through \ref{fig:render_right} show standard view renders of the SolidWorks model. Note that the robot uses mecanum wheels (a type of omni-directional wheel) which are modeled as plain wheels for simplicity. Figure \ref{fig:render_top} also indicates the front, left, back/rear, and right sides of the robot as referenced in the rest of the paper.  The robot contains 53 unique parts, of which 24 are custom designed, and 394 parts in total. The bill of materials can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:mech_bom}.

The design emphasizes the use of 3D printed parts to take advantage of the benefits of the technology including rapid part production, high part complexity, and low fabrication cost (excluding the cost of the printer, relative to other methods such as machining, casting, and injection molding). Parts were printed on a MakerGear M2 fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer equipped with a 0.35 mm diameter nozzle using MakerGeeks 1.75 mm ABS thermoplastic filament. Print speeds of 20 to 80 mm/s with 0.20 mm layer height, depending on part dimensions and minimum feature size, lead to part print times of 2 to 5 hours for smaller components up to 26 hours for the ball hopper. Due to the non-isotropic strength characteristic of 3D printed components (greater tensile strength in the X and Y axes but significantly weaker in Z), the designs must specifically take into account printing direction and orientation. Additionally, the print volume of 200 mm x 250 mm x 200 mm limits the maximum part dimensions thus requiring the ball hopper to printed as three separate pieces \cite{makergear_m2}. 

\section{Base Platform}
The 315 mm x 275 mm base platform of the robot, made from 1/4" thick medium density fiberboard (MDF), serves as the primary structural component and mounting point for the motors, electronics, shooting mechanism, and hopper. The wood is laser cut with a 20 mm grid of 4 mm diameter holes to allow modular placement of components, and the corner cutouts allow clearance for the wheels. Long slots permit wire routing from the motors to the motor drivers above. Figure \ref{fig:base_platform} shows the subassembly with labels.

\end{figure}

Four 12V Pololu 37D motors geared at a 70:1 ratio drive each of the 60 mm diameter mecanum wheels. Figure \ref{fig:motor_assem_explode} displays an exploded view of the motor assembly. 3D printed couplings, detailed in Figure \ref{fig:wheel_coupler}, connect the wheels to the 6 mm diameter, D-shaped motor shafts. The couplers use M2 nuts and bolts to clamp onto the motor shaft and an octagonal stub that press fits into the center of the wheels. Three long M3 bolts and nylon lock nuts clamp the mecanum wheels together and to the coupler. Each wheel contains eight angled rollers mounted with two ball bearings each to smooth operation under load. Unlike regular wheels which only produce a force vector perpendicular to the axis, mecanum wheels also produce a vector parallel to the axis. With the appropriate combination of speed and direction of each wheel, the robot can achieve simultaneous translation and rotation in any direction.

Several electronic components are mounted directly on the base platform. Along the four edges of the platform, four STMicroelectronics VL53L0X laser rangefinders seated on 3D printed brackets sense distance. These sensors cost between \$6 to \$20 mounted on a small PCB with supporting circuitry and can sense distances between 30 mm and 2000 mm at a rate of 30 Hz and less than 10\% error in most test conditions \cite{vl53l0x_datasheet}. A 4S, 1200 mAH LiPo battery mounted with an industrial strength hook-and-loop fastener powers the system through a on/off toggle switch seated in a 3D printed bracket. Three dual H-bridge motor drivers are attached with nylon standoffs and M3 nuts and bolts. Finally, a momentary push button in a 3D printed bracket toggles power to the Raspberry Pi microcomputer.

\section{Shooting Mechanism}
The shooting mechanism naturally takes inspiration from the official Nerf Rival Blaster toys since they're specifically optimized to fire Nerf Rival balls; the system works similarly to a baseball pitching machine. Figure \ref{fig:shooter_explode} shows an exploded view of the subassembly while Figure \ref{fig:shooter_top} displays the top view. The mechanism consists of two sections: the \textbf{barrel} (left green part in Figure \ref{fig:shooter_explode}) and the \textbf{wheel housing} (right green part in Figure \ref{fig:shooter_explode}). Both parts were 3D printed as the geometries are highly complex. Therefore, the shooting mechanism consists of two separate components versus a unibody design to allow each half to be fabricated with optimal print direction, strength, and finish quality. The barrel is angled \ang{6} above horizontal, targeting the vertical center of the nets 6 feet away.

\begin{figure}[H]   % [h] means here
	\centering \includegraphics[width=6in, height=3.85in, keepaspectratio]{figures/shooter_explode.png}
	\caption{Shooting Mechanism -- Exploded View}	\label{fig:shooter_explode}
\end{figure}

	\caption{Shooting Mechanism -- Top View}	\label{fig:shooter_top}
\end{figure}

The \textbf{barrel} directs balls from the \textbf{ball hopper} to the \textbf{wheel housing}. First, the ball enters the barrel through a vertical chute by force of gravity. As the ball falls into the barrel, a high-pressure centrifugal (or blower fan) attached at the back of the barrel pushes it into the wheel housing inlet. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:shooter_xsec}, the barrel slightly narrows in the area behind the top chute to prevent the ball from rolling backwards towards the blower fan. A loft feature creates a smooth transition between the rectangular fan inlet and the circular barrel. The foam balls, nominally 23 mm in diameter, would occasionally jam in a 24 mm inner diameter barrel due to ball surface imperfections so the barrel was increased to 25 mm inner diameter. In the initial design, the pressure created by the blower fan was so high that it prevented the ball from falling down the vertical chute. The revised barrel uses strategically placed vents reduce the barrel pressure before the ball enters the chute. As the ball travels down the chute into the barrel, it blocks the vents, increasing the pressure and forcing the itself into the wheel housing.

	\caption{Shooting Mechanism -- Cross Section View}	\label{fig:shooter_xsec}
\end{figure}

Inside the \textbf{wheel housing}, two counter-rotating 34mm wheels press fitted to two high-speed 12 V motors rapidly accelerate the foam ball up to 50 feet per second. The 14 mm gap between wheels compresses the ball to increase grip, thereby improving energy transfer. The motors lightly press fit into the wheel housing and are secured with 3D printed braces. The perimeter of each 3D printed wheel, detailed in Figure \ref{fig:shooter_wheel}, consists of a ribbed V-groove to increase the contact patch and grip with the compressed foam ball. Two "feet" with bolt holes at the bottom of the barrel and wheel housing secure the shooting mechanism to the base platform.

	\caption{Shooting Mechanism -- Shooter Wheel}	\label{fig:shooter_wheel}
\end{figure}

The shooting mechanism performed consistently; in a trial of 100 launches, 100\% of balls passed through a 6 inch diameter ring placed 6 feet away where the center of the competition net would be. Since the actual nets are 24 inches in diameter, no further testing was required. The projectile speed averaged 48.1 ft/s with 1.2 ft/s standard deviation as determined with a light gate speed measurement tool after tuning motor speed in the microcontroller.

\section{Ball Hopper}
During the competition, the robot must obtain the foam balls from supply tubes mounted on two sides of the side. The supply tubes consist of two 1" inner diameter PVC tee joints and an eyebolt. The bottoms of the supply tubes are positioned seven inches above the floor and a swinging flap holds the balls in as shown in Figure \ref{fig:supply_tubes}. The ball hopper, shown in Figure \ref{fig:ball_hopper} is a large 3D printed component designed to push the swinging flap away, collect the balls, store them, and dispense them into the shooting mechanism. Figure \ref{fig:ball_hopper_explode} shows an exploded view of the subassembly.

\begin{figure}[H]   % [h] means here
	\centering \includegraphics[width=6in, height=3.85in, keepaspectratio]{figures/supply_tubes.png}
	\caption{Supply Tube}	\label{fig:supply_tubes}
\end{figure}

\end{figure}

	\caption{Ball Hopper -- Exploded View}	\label{fig:ball_hopper_explode}
\end{figure}

To obtain balls, the robot first positions itself such that the wide portion of hopper resides next to the supply tube. The robot then moves such that the metal rods at the top of the ball hopper push the eyebolt aside. As the flap swings open, the balls roll out of the supply tube and down the steep sloped portion of the hopper. Visible in the cross section view of Figure \ref{fig:ball_hopper_xsec}, the slope rapidly becomes shallower in order to convert the balls' downward momentum into sideways momentum which keeps balls from jamming against each other. The balls then roll into one of two channels before stopping at the dispensing gate.

	\caption{Ball Hopper -- Cross Section View}	\label{fig:ball_hopper_xsec}
\end{figure}

The dispensing gate, shown in Figure \ref{fig:dispensing_gate}, controls the movement of balls between hopper channels and the shooting mechanism entrance. Its complex shape directs balls into the hole at the bottom of the ball hopper from one channel at a time to prevent jamming. A standard \ang{180} rotation servo, mounted in a 3D printed bracket above the center of the hopper, controls the dispensing gate.  Fastened to the same bracket, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) measures magnetic compass heading and acceleration in three dimensions. The IMU is positioned at the rotational center of the robot to prevent the accelerometer from measuring robot rotation as linear movement. The ball hopper is mounted at three points: the top of the shooting mechanism and the left and right edges of the robot using 3D printed and acrylic braces shown in Figure \ref{fig:hopper_brace}.

\section{Control Unit}
The control unit, shown in Figure \ref{fig:control_unit}, consists of a 1/4" MDF board with various electronic components mounted: two off-the-shelf DC-DC switching converters, a custom interconnect printed circuit board (PCB), an off-the-shelf STM32 Nucleo-64 development board, and the Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Two 3D printed standoffs, the green parts shown in Figure \ref{fig:control_unit_standoffs}, connect the control unit to the platform and raise it slightly to avoid colliding with the robot's wheels.
