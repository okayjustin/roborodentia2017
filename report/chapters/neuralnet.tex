\section{Introduction}
The robot controls its motors using the artificial neural networks and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, produced by Lillicrap et al. The system runs in Python 3, leaning heavily on the TensorFlow library.

\section{Reinforcement Learning Concepts}
Reinforcement learning is a subset of machine learning that aims to solve control problems rather than classification or data clustering. Typically,

\section{Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}
Many reinforcement learning algorithms have been applied to control including Q-Learning, State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), among others.

\subsection{Q-Learning}
Q-Learning is an off-model, off-policy 

\subsection{State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA)}
SARSA is an on-policy algorithm similar which shares many characteristics with Q-Learning.
