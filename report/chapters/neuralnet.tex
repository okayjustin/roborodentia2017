\section{Introduction}
The robot controls its motors using the artificial neural networks and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), one of various reinforcement learning algorithm. The system runs in Python 3, leaning heavily on the TensorFlow library.

\section{Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}
Various reinforcement learning algorithms exist including Q-Learning, State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), among others.

\subsection{Q-Learning}
Q-Learning is an off-model, 

\subsection{State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA)}
SARSA is an on-policy algorithm similar which shares many characteristics with Q-Learning.
